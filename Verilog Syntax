Case sensitive.
Sized Numbers EX-2'b10 here 2 is size,binary is the type and 10 is the number
Int a = 'h3AD4 here integer is declared so it automatically has 32 bits size.
Negative numbers are declared with a minus sign should be at the start.
Strings are declared with double quotes and cannot be multiple line .
A Simple D Flip Flop Code-
module dff (input a ,clk,rstn;
            output reg dd;)
   always@(posedge clk) begin
   if (!rstn)
   q <= 0;
   
   else 
   
   q <= d;
   
end

endmodule

AND Gate-

   module AND_2(output Y, input A, B);
    and(Y, A, B); 
endmodule
  
OR Gate-
 module OR_2(output Y, input A, B);
    or(Y, A, B); 
endmodule
 
XOR Gate-
module XOR_2_gate_level(output Y, input A, B);
    xor (Y, A, B); 
endmodule

Different Data Types-
Nets- Equivalent to connedcting hardware components
Wires-Can be vectors as well
integer-a 32 bit general purpose data type
time-used to assign simulation time
realtime-stores simulation time as a float type.

net is 1 bit wide if a range is not specified that is a scalar
a vector is defined as -
wire [7:0] n0
where 7 is the most significsnt bit and 0 is the least significant bit
various data members can be accessed by the array indices 
for example-
in the above example -
n0[0]=1;
n[0]=2;
and so forth.

string uses-
module test
reg [8*11:0] str1;
reg[8*5:0] str2;
reg[8*21:0] str3;

initial begin
str1 = "hello world";
str2 = "hello world";
str3 = "hello world";

$display("str1 = %s",str1);
$display("str2 = %s",str2);
$display("str3 = %s",str3);

in secon d case only world is printed rest is truncated and in the third case "      hello world" is printed as the leftmost spaces are filled as spaces.
ARRAYS-
wire y1[3:0] where y has depth of 4 amd 1 bit wide each 
wire [15:0] y1 [3:0] where y1 has 16 bit wide and depth of 4
wire [15:0] y1 [3:0][0:7] where y1 is a 2d array

PORTS-
There are three types of ports-
inout,input,output;
signed is a declaration we use for signed representation of a signal
